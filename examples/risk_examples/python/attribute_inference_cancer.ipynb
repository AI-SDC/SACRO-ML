    "Scientists have created a model to predict the risk of suffering cancer for people who suffer multiple disorders. This model is expected to save lives.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same scientist published the details of their research, how the model was built and a detailed description of the data (e.g., the health conditions investigated), the NHS board where the data was collected. The data was deidentified and was not released as it is confidential patient information, and any leak might break existing legislation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The researchers balanced the benefits and potential risks of the model realease, and it was decided that overall, there is a clear benefit for the population for the model to be made public.\n",
    "\n",
    "What they didnâ€™t realise, is that the NHS board in question is home to a famous Member of Parliament (MP). This famous MP is a former Prime Minister, and it is of public knowledge he suffered from cancer. Also, it is straightforward for anyone to do an online search and find some other details for this individual (age etc).\n",

    "## Attribute Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use this example to demonstrate an _attribute inference_ attack. In such an attack, an attacker has access to some information about a particular individual but not all, and attempts to use the model to fill in the gaps in their knowledge. In this particular example, some aspects of the MPs health are public knowledgey. We will use that information, and a trained model, to find out information particular to this individual that is not in the public domain, and should remain in the TRE."

The more extreme these scores become (e.g one is close to 1 and the other to 0 (recall that they have to add up to 1)), the more _confident_ the model is in assigning that example.

For each query, the attacker will record the score for the cancer group. The attacker will assume that the higher this score (i.e. the more confident the model), the more likely that the values are correct. Note that we used the confidence in the cancer group (rather than non-cancer) because the attacker _knows_ that the MP had cancer and would therefore have been in the cancer group.\n",

    "With this example, we have demonstrated how an attacker who has some information about an individual in the model's training set and is allowed to query the model can potentially learn information about that individual. This is known as an _attribute inference_ attack, and it makes use of the fact that under some configurations, models can be more confident on examples they've seen during training than on examples that they haven't.\n",
    "\n",
    "The susceptibility of a model to attack depends, to a significant degree, on their configuration. In the case of an SVM, changing the `gamma` parameter can control how safe the model is. Although the details of an SVM's `gamma` parameter are not important, it's important to see how small changes in a model's configuration can have dramatic changes in their vulnerability. "
