    "We now assume the role of the attacker. The attacker knows some general properties about the data -- for example, they know the range of values each variable can take. They also know the configuration of the classifier that was trained (that it was an SVM and any parameters that were used to define it (more on this later)). Finally, they know (or can make a good guess at) the input data for the MP (they are famous and this information is perhaps in the public domain). The attacker is going to try and determine, from this information, and with access to the trained model, whether or not the MP was in the dataset and hence determine if they had cancer or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How does the attack work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that when we used the model to make predictions, the model provided two scores -- the cancer and non-cancer scores. The more extreme these scores become (e.g one is close to 1 and the other to 0 (recall that they have to add up to 1)), the more _confident_ the model is in assigning that example. It is not uncommon for models to have higher confidence for examples that they were trained on than examples that they haven't seen before. It is this property that the attacker will make use of.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, the attacker will generate their own dataset (known as _shadow_ data) that has similar properties to the original. They can do this randomly -- it doesn't matter that it won't be quite right -- all they need to know is the rough ranges of the variables. They will then use some of this data to train their own model (a _shadow_ model). This allows them to see roughly what kind of confidence their model gives to examples it was trained on, and examples it wasn't trained on. This gives them an idea about how confident the original model is likely to be on data it was trained on, and data it wasn't trained on. Comparing this to the actual confidence obtained when the MPs data is given to the original model will allow them to infer if the MP was in the training data or not.\n",
    "\n",

Such information is often available at population levels (e.g. average age, proportion of population with diabetes etc).\n",
