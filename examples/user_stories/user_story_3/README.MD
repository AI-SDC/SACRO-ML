# User story 3

# User provides dataset object but does not use SafeModel

There exist a vast number of classifiers available and only for a few the SafeModel wrapper exists. Therefore, for some purposes will not be possible to use the SafeModel class.

However, the user has provided a copy of their training data alongside the model to be released. By using this package, the TRE can therefore check the hyperparameters of the model, as well as running attacks and generating reports which will help the TRE to make a decision regarding whether the model should be released.
