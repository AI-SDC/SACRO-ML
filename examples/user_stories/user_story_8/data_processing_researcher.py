"""SUPPORTING FILE FOR USER STORY 2.

This file is an example of a function created by a researcher that will
pre-process a dataset

To use: write a function that will process your input data, and output the
processed version

NOTE: in order to work, this function needs to:

    - take a single parameter (the data to be processed)
    - return a dictionary
    - which contains the keys ]
        ['n_features_raw_data', 'X_transformed', 'y_transformed', 'train_indices']
