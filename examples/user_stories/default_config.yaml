# Researcher should fill in this file with relevant parameters for the model
# they are releasing. Parameters tagged with a 'generated by code' label are
# files that are generated by sacroml. You can change the filename, but it is
# not necessary. All other parameters need to be set by either the researcher
# or TRE.
