## Style Guide

Python code should be linted with [pylint](https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint).

A [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) configuration [file](../tree/main/.pre-commit-config.yaml) is provided to automatically:
* Trim trailing whitespace and fix line endings;
* Check for spelling errors;
* Check and format JSON files;
* Format Python and notebooks;
* Upgrade Python syntax;
* Automatically remove unused Python imports;
* Sort Python imports.

Pre-commit can be setup as follows:
```
$ pip install pre-commit
```
Then to run on all files in the repository:
```
$ pre-commit run -a
```

Pre-commit can be configured to automatically run on every `git commit` with:
```
$ pre-commit install
```

## Documentation

Documentation is hosted here: https://ai-sdc.github.io/SACRO-ML/

The documentation is automatically built using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org) and github actions.

The source files in `docs/source` are parsed/compiled into HTML files in `docs/_build`. The contents of `docs/_build` is pushed to the gh-pages branch which is then automatically deployed to the above site.

The main configuration file is `docs/source/conf.py`. Most commonly the path variable will pick up any source to document occasionally directories might need adding top the path. Please ensure to use `abspath()`

Sphinx reads the docstrings in the Python source.

It uses the numpydoc format. Your code should be documented with [numpydoc](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html) comments.

### Quick Start

Need to get your documentation into the generated docs?

If your docstrings are in the right format, this method should work for most cases:

1. Go to `docs/source`
2. Make a copy of an rst file, e.g., `safedecisiontree.rst`
3. Edit the new file and change the title and automodule line.
4. Save the new file.
5. Edit the `index.rst` and insert the new filename (without the .rst) into the correct position in the list.
6. Save `index.rst`
7. Merge your updates to main.

### Static and Generated Content

The rst files in `docs/source/` are a mixture of static and generated content. Static content should be written in reStructuredText (rst) format.

There are lots of online tutorials for writing rst such as the [Restructured Text Primer](https://thomas-cokelaer.info/tutorials/sphinx/rest_syntax.html).

### Images

It is possible to include images like this

```
.. image:: stars.jpg
    :width: 200px
    :align: center
    :height: 100px
    :alt: alternate text
```

### Generating Docs Locally

It is useful to be able to generate your docs locally (to check for bugs, etc.)

First install the Python dependencies with:

```
$ pip install .[doc]
```

Then run Sphinx with the following command and it should create a folder `docs/_build/html/` that will contain the html files where you can open the index.html with your web browser.

```
$ sphinx-build ./docs/source ./docs/_build/html/
```
