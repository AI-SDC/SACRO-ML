SACRO-ML: Machine Learning Privacy Tools
=========================================

SACRO-ML is a free and open source collection of tools and resources for managing the statistical disclosure control (SDC) of trained machine learning models. It provides both ante-hoc and post-hoc privacy assessment capabilities for researchers working with ML models in secure data environments.

.. note::
   **New in v1.4.0:** Enhanced support for PyTorch models and improved structural attack capabilities.
