What is SACRO-ML?
-----------------
SACRO-ML is a set of tools for disclosure control of trained Machine Lerning (ML) models. ML models enable the discovery of intricate relationships that a human eye, and traditional statistical methods canâ€™t. This type of tools are powerful and are becoming increasingly popular many different fields including for medical aplications and other projects involving personal and sensitive data. Data breaches must be avoided. SACRO-ML helps to apply some mitigation startegies like the use of safemodels and estimate the risk of data leakage.

What is safemodel?
------------------

The safemodel package is an open source wrapper for common machine learning
models. It is designed for use by researchers in Trusted Research Environments
(TREs) where disclosure control methods must be implemented.

Safemodel aims to give researchers greater confidence that their models are
more compliant with disclosure control.

Safemodel provides feedback to the researcher through a JSON parseable
'checkfile' report:

.. code-block:: json

	{
	    "researcher": "andy",
	    "model_type": "DecisionTreeClassifier",
	    "model_save_file": "unsafe.pkl",
	    "details": "WARNING: model parameters may present a disclosure risk:\n- para
	meter min_samples_leaf = 1 identified as less than the recommended min value of
	5.",
	    "recommendation": "Do not allow release",
	    "reason": "WARNING: model parameters may present a disclosure risk:\n- param
	eter min_samples_leaf = 1 identified as less than the recommended min value of 5
	.Error: user has not called fit() method or has deleted saved values.Recommendat
	ion: Do not release."
	}
