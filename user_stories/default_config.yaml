# DIRECTIONS FOR USE
# Researcher should fill in this file with relevant parameters for the model they are releasing
# Parameters tagged with a 'generated by code' label are files that are generated by aisdc
# You can change the filename, but it is not necessary
# All other parameters need to be set by either the researcher or TRE

# Scenario to be run
